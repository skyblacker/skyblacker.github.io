<a href="https://feyeselftrim.livejournal.com/">This</a> is how I trim my hair with a scrunchie and haircutting shears (the cheap kind is fine but they have to be shears, not kitchen scissors). I trim just enough to remove the majority of split ends. Then I "search and destroy": run a narrow comb through my hair an and snip individual split ends as they snag the comb. This preserves more length than a salon, which simply finds the highest split end and cuts to that.
